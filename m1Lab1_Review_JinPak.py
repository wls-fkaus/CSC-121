Get number of candles to purchase from the user.
if num_item between 1-19, it will cost 4.75 each
if num_item between 20-49, it will cost 4.50 each
if num_item between 50-99, it will cost 4.25 each
if num_item is greater than or equal to 100, it will cost 4.00 each

calculate total by multiplying num_item and cost per item.
